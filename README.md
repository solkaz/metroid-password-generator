# Metroid Password Generator

Password generator for the game *Metroid* on NES. Built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This works for both NTSC and PAL versions, but not the FDS (since saving to the disk was allowed)

Still a WIP. Feel free to make an issue or submit PRs

## Acknowledgements
- John Ratliff, for his [guide on the Metroid password format](http://games.technoplaza.net/mpg/password.txt) and his own [password generator program](http://games.technoplaza.net/mpg/), both of which I referenced in making this.

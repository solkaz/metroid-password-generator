# Metroid Password Generator

[Check it out on Heroku](https://metroid-password-generator.herokuapp.com/)

Password generator for the game *Metroid* on NES. Built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This works for both the NTSC and PAL versions, but not the Famicom Disk System (FDS), since saving was implemented in that version.

Feel free to make an issue or submit a PR.
